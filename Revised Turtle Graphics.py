# Project: Flower Screensaver â€“ Turtle Graphics (OOP Python Project at UNCW)
# Objective: Create an animated flower-drawing screensaver using Turtle graphics.
# Enhancements:
#   - Prevent flowers from overlapping
#   - Screen size mimics iPhone dimensions (390x844 px)
#   - Gradient coloring (purples & pinks)
#   - Cleaner, more modular code with better documentation
